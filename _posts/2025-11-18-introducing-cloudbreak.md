title: "Introducing CloudBreak: Privacy-Focused Hosting for the Small Tech Movement"

CloudBreak offers professionally hosted, open-source alternatives to Big Tech services. We believe in privacy, transparency, and putting you in control of your digital life.

## Our Philosophy

When a service is free, **you** are often the product. CloudBreak takes a different approach: you pay a small fee for great service, allowing us to be sustainable while protecting your privacy instead of exploiting it.

We're built on three core principles:

**Privacy First**: Your data belongs to you. We don't track your activity, analyze your content, or sell your information.

**Open Source**: We build on trusted open-source software. No black boxes, no vendor lock-in—just transparent technology you can trust.

**Data Portability**: Not happy? Take your data and go. We make migration easy because your freedom to choose matters.
