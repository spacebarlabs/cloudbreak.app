**Welcome to CloudBreak!**

We're excited to have you here. CloudBreak is built on the belief that your reading habits, your news interests, and your data should belong to **you** — not to advertisers, not to big tech companies, and not to anyone else.

This is your new home for privacy-focused RSS reading.

## What Will Appear in this Feed?

This is the "Subscriber News" feed. We promise to keep it low-volume. We will only use this to post updates that directly affect your experience, such as new feature rollouts, new services, upgrades, or upcoming maintenance windows.

Note: Critical alerts (such as planned downtime) will also be emailed to ensure you don't miss them.

## What Makes CloudBreak Different?

**Privacy First**: We don't track what you read, we don't analyze your feeds, and we don't sell your data. Your RSS subscriptions and reading history are yours alone.

**Open Source Foundation**: CloudBreak is built on trusted open-source software. No black boxes, no vendor lock-in, just transparent technology you can trust.

**Your Data, Your Control**: Export your feeds anytime via OPML. We want you to stay because you love the service, not because you are locked in.

## Getting Started

Setting up your RSS reader is simple:

1. **Import Your Feeds**: Have existing subscriptions? Import them using OPML format from your previous reader.  In FreshRSS, go to the **Subscription Management** section to import an OPML file from your previous reader.
2. **Discover New Content**: Browse the web and subscribe to your favorite blogs and news sites directly.
3. **Read on Your Terms**: No algorithms deciding what you should see. Just your feeds, in chronological order, the way news was meant to be.

## Join the Small Tech Movement

By choosing CloudBreak, you're supporting an alternative to the surveillance-based business models that dominate the web. You're choosing to pay for a service with money instead of with your privacy and attention.

Thank you for trusting us with your RSS reading. We're committed to keeping CloudBreak simple, reliable, and respectful of your privacy.

Happy reading!
