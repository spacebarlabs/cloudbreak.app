Welcome to CloudBreak, your new home for privacy-focused RSS reading!

We're excited to have you here. CloudBreak is built on the belief that your reading habits, your news interests, and your data should belong to **you** — not to advertisers, not to big tech companies, and not to anyone else.

## What Makes CloudBreak Different?

**Privacy First**: We don't track what you read, we don't analyze your feeds, and we don't sell your data. Your RSS subscriptions and reading history are yours alone.

**Open Source Foundation**: CloudBreak is built on trusted open-source software. No black boxes, no vendor lock-in, just transparent technology you can trust.

**Your Data, Your Control**: Export your feeds anytime. If you decide CloudBreak isn't for you, taking your data with you is just a click away.

## Getting Started

Setting up your RSS reader is simple:

1. **Import Your Feeds**: Have existing subscriptions? Import them using OPML format from your previous reader.
2. **Discover New Content**: Browse and subscribe to your favorite blogs, news sites, and podcasts.
3. **Read on Your Terms**: No algorithms deciding what you should see. Just your feeds, in chronological order, the way RSS was meant to be.

## Join the Small Tech Movement

By choosing CloudBreak, you're supporting an alternative to the surveillance-based business models that dominate the web. You're choosing to pay for a service with money instead of with your privacy and attention.

Thank you for trusting us with your RSS reading. We're committed to keeping CloudBreak simple, reliable, and respectful of your privacy.

Happy reading!
